# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CICD

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
#    branches:
#    - main
##    - staging
##    - develop
    tags:
      - 'v*' # Push events to matching v*, i.e. v1.0, v20.15.10
#  pull_request:
#    branches:
#    - main
##    - staging
##    - develop

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # The "build" workflow
  build:
